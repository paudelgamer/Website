# Insurance-Sathi

## Conventions

* All code should be formatted with [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
* Common css styles should be placed in `src/app.css`
* Try to name all you variables in camelCase or PascalCase. If you notice inconsistencies, you may change it and open a pull request.
* Try not to make multiple Push Requests. Be efficient. 
* Commit messages from here on out should be in the format of `<type>: <description>` where `type` is one of the following:
  * feat: A new feature
  * fix: A bug fix
  * docs: Documentation only changes
  * style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  * perf: A code change that improves performance
  * chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
